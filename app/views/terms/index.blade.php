        <div class="privacy_section">
            <h4 class="privacy_2"><b>PAYMENT</b></h4>
            <p class="privacy_2">EIDEAL accepts payment via this website using the following credit cards Visa, MasterCard. 
            Your payment will be confirmed via e-mail. This is in addition to your order confirmation from EIDEAL.
            When it comes to making purchases and the pricing of products, pay attention to the details of the transaction, because your total price may include taxes, fees, and shipping costs, all of which you are responsible for funding.
            Keep in mind that you may be presented with additional terms related to a specific purchase before you confirm the transaction (such as shipping terms for tangible goods). Those additional terms will also govern that transaction.
            When it comes to the payment methods, however you choose to purchase the products you are automatically agreeing to the following: 
             <br/><br/>
            1.  That you are authorized and permitted to use this funding instrument. When you fund a transaction, you authorize us (and our designated payment processor) to charge the full amount to the funding instrument you designate for the transaction. You also authorize us to collect and store the funding instrument's details, along with other related transaction information. 
              <br/><br/>
            2.  If you pay by credit, we may obtain a pre-approval from the issuer of the card for an amount, which may be as high as the full price of your purchase. We will bill your card at the time you load funds for your payments transaction, or shortly thereafter. If you cancel a transaction before completion, this pre-approval may result in those funds not otherwise being immediately available to you.
             <br/><br/>
            3.  If you fund a payment by debit card and your load transaction results in an overdraft or other fee from your bank, you alone are responsible for that fee.<br/><br/>
            EIDEAL also maintains the right to cancel any transaction if we believe the transaction violates these Terms or if we believe doing so may prevent financial loss. We may also cancel any electronic value accumulated, transferred, assigned, or sold as a result of fraudulent or illegal behavior. Furthermore, if any problems or shortcoming are detected on your end related to the transaction or if you suspect that an order is being placed without your consent you agree to notify us immediately (within 10 days), so that we may take action to prevent financial loss. 
            Lastly, if you experience a technical failure or interruption of service that causes your funding transaction to fail, you may request that your transaction be completed at a later time.
